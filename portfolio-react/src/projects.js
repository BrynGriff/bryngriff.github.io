        "paragraph": "Persist is a third-person multiplayer roguelike dungeon crawler game made in Unity Engine. I was the lead programmer and co-designer of this project; my main roles included the creation and upkeep of all backend combat and gameloop features (items, stats, buffs, UI) as well as the network programming. Our team was composed of 5 artists and 2 programmers. It was the largest project I have worked on, taking approximately 1 year to develop from the initial prototype to a free release on itch.io. Many of the underlying systems from the game had already been featured in previous projects (Forgotten Constructs, Mages of the Abyss) so a large amount of this development time was dedicated to refining existing systems as well as creating brand new ones."

        "header": "Content",
        "paragraph": "Persist is the most feature-rich project I worked on at Media Design School, featuring 4 boss encounters, 21 enemies, 21 items, and 14 spells. Players can choose what rooms to enter next and also what items they are given (out of a choice of 3). They can also earn perk points by leveling up, used to increase different stats. We designed this with the intention of giving the players the ability to fully customise different builds in each run, augmented by a small amount of randomness to make each run feel unique. The game is endless, and enemies will get progressively stronger until all players have been defeated."
      },
      {
        "header": "Character Building",
        "paragraph": "Giving the players freedom to take their character build in the direction they choose was a large part of our development philosophy when making design choices for Persist. Games often avoid allowing the player to become too powerful through stacking certain combinations together or simply stacking the same item. Items and stats in Persist are infinitely stackable, allowing players to learn the quirks and synergies of each item to create powerful (if not broken) combinations with enough game knowledge and a bit of luck. The game was designed with this exponential power increase in mind, as the enemies will still get stronger to be able to match the player."

        "header": "Networking",
        "paragraph": "The networked multiplayer was the most integral aspect of developing this game, and every other system had to be adjusted or created to fit the server-client architecture. Multiplayer was handled with Unity Mirror, though some aspects were heavily tweaked, such as the lobby system. Combat and player actions were handled using an improved version of the state machine system I created for Forgotten Constructs, tweaked to sync states over the network."

        "header": "Inspirations",
        "paragraph": "Persist was inspired by several titles that we referred back to from time to time to gauge the level of polish we could still add in our timeframe. The roguelike dungeon crawler elements were inspired by games such as Risk of Rain, Dead Cells and the Binding of Isaac. The fast-paced hack-and-slash combat was inspired by games like Kingdom Hearts, Devil May Cry and the Souls series."

As such, each page collapses down into a format that can be read and navigated easily on mobile. The images on the right of each project page collapse into a scrollable gallery at the top of the page. On the homepage, the number of columns on the project buttons decreases, and the layout becomes vertical."

        "header": "Transitions",
        "paragraph": "Because the page features a loading screen while content loads, elements had to be managed so they fired when the page loaded. To account for this and streamline transition creation, I created an element attribute that allows customizable transitions with length, direction, distance, and delay that executes in Javascript on page load. This allowed me to script images, headers, and buttons to load in sequence and with varying distance without having to create new CSS for each transition type."

This project was moved up from being one of our prototypes to being one of our two 'mini-productions', created over 4 weeks following a 1 week prototype.

The game features a Metroidvania style progression, where the players progress and collect items and abilities that allow them to access more areas. The players can encounter enemies inside locked rooms and must defeat them before progressing.

        "paragraph": "The game's combat system was made using the first iteration of the state machine system I created that would eventually be used in Persist. This allows certain actions to overlap, certain actions to queue, as well as making some actions sequential with specific transition timings, such as combo attack of the melee knight. This was expanded in future projects to add much more functionality such as advanced queuing, network state cloning and further integration with character systems."

Aside from one attack performed by the final boss that traps a player, all the content of the game could theoretically be completed with just one player. Some ideas to explore this further include character specific abilities to expand on the Metroidvania aspects of the game and give each player character their own role in the progression, or systems that require both players to act in sync to achieve a goal, such as an enemy or puzzle mechanic."

A limiting factor for this project was that most of the underlying functions of the toys were almost identical. Every toy acts as a key to open a path that cannot be crossed with the key that opened it, causing some of them to feel redundant. Something to explore in the future would be adding unique rules to each toy allowing certain paths to behave differently, or overhauling some of the toys entirely to make each one have a unique effect on the gameplay."

The sled slows the player's movement speed but allows them to stockpile resources to make emergency situations more manageable. The sled can be ditched at any time.

Between each wave of invaders, a boss will appear and fight the player with unique attacks and gimmicks.

The first idea was allowing the player to move in a limited 2D space, followed by the shield and ultimate laser, followed by creating the first boss prototype. More ideas came from there to further refine and enhance the gameplay to a point where it doesn't just feel like a space invaders clone, despite looking like one on a surface level glance."

At this stage if I were to continue working on this game it would have to be rebuilt from the ground up to shake out some of the hacky inexperienced code choices. The game would have lost most of its Space Invader elements and become a more traditional bullet hell game, keeping the same artstyle. The main ship would have become one of several, with each ship featuring different abilities. More enemies, bosses and environments would have been added, as well as a complete story."

This algorithm simulates the pink dot's survival in this forest, determined by its ability to value different resources and the distance it takes to reach them. There are 3 resources on the map: food, wood, and water. Food and wood both function identically in that they replenish when there are few on the map, but the survivor needs more food than wood each day to survive. Water is needed the most, but there are only 3 nodes on the map at any given time, and they change locations each day. The survivor requires enough food, water, and wood to survive each day and can only spend a certain amount of energy moving between nodes before having to go home. The survivor can mutate its priority for each resource node separately and how much it values closer nodes. The best 2 survivors in each generation will create the next generation with various mutations. Leaving the simulation running, the best mutated survivors in the later generations can survive for thousands of days."
